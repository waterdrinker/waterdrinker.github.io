You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

 Left align | Right align | Center align 
:-----------|------------:|:------------:
 This       |        This |     This     
 column     |      column |    column    
 will       |        will |     will     
 be         |          be |      be      
 left       |       right |    center    
 aligned    |     aligned |   aligned 

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)
