```python
def print_hi(name):
	print 'Hi, %s' % name

print_hi('Tom')
```

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)
